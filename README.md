# Cryptocurrencies

## Background

Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies and asks me to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm to help determine about investing in this product. Sheâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the best way forward for our dataset because we are looking for any groupings, trends, or other information that could help you pitch cryptocurrencies to her firm.

## Objective

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Intructions

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Results
